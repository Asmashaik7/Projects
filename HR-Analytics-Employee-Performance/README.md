📊 Key Insights
Performance

Only ~35% employees meet KPI expectations.

Referral hiring shows 53% KPI success, the highest among recruitment channels.

More trainings ≠ better performance → Training quality matters more than quantity.

Retention

Operations & Procurement have the highest retention (6+ years).

High performers & award winners leave earlier → recognition but weak retention strategy.

Legal, R&D & Analytics show lower retention → potential workload/role mismatch.

Education & Performance

Masters stay the longest (~7.3 years) but do not always perform the best.

Below-secondary perform decently but leave early (~1.7 years).

Bachelors form the largest employee base with average performance + retention.

Priority learning support for Sales & Marketing, Legal, and R&D teams

Retention & Engagement

Provide career pathways for high performers to reduce early exits

Link awards with incentives, promotions, and development programs

📌 Final Conclusion

This analysis shows that:

Performance depends on skill alignment, not just education.
Retention depends on opportunity & growth, not just experience.

The organization recognizes performance but doesn’t fully retain it.
Improving training quality, reward structure, and career path clarity will increase both KPI success and employee loyalty.
