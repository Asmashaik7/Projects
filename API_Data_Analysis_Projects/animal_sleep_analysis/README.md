🐾 Animal Sleep Analysis – EDA Project
📌 Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project analyzing sleep patterns across animal species to understand how sleep duration varies based on taxonomic order, dietary category, and body weight.
Data was loaded from an external source and analyzed using Python.

🎯 Objectives

* Analyze total sleep and REM sleep patterns

* Study sleep variation by:

* Animal order

* Dietary category (vore)

* Body weight

* Identify key biological and environmental drivers of sleep

🛠️ Tools Used

* Python

* Pandas

* Matplotlib

* Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Key Analysis

* Univariate analysis of total sleep, REM sleep, and sleep cycle

* Bivariate analysis by:

* Animal order

* Dietary category

* Body weight

* Species-level validation to support group-level insights

* Scatter plot (log scale) for body weight vs total sleep

✅ Key Findings

* Total sleep varies widely across animal species.

* Small-bodied animals sleep significantly more than large-bodied animals.

* Large-bodied animals show very low total sleep duration.

* Aquatic animals sleep less than land animals of similar body weight.

* Dietary category partially explains sleep patterns.

* REM sleep shows high variability and missing data, making it less consistent than total sleep.

🧠 Conclusion

Body weight is the strongest and most consistent predictor of total sleep duration, with diet, taxonomic order, and habitat acting as modifying factors.
REM sleep patterns are less stable and should be interpreted cautiously.

🔑 Key Takeaway

Small animals sleep more, large animals sleep less, and aquatic animals sleep the least.
