**🎵 Chinook SQL Analysis**
**📌 Overview**

This project presents a SQL Server (T-SQL)–based analysis of the Chinook database, a sample digital music store database.
The analysis focuses on answering business-oriented questions related to sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends using real relational data.

The project demonstrates my ability to work with multi-table databases, write structured and optimized SQL queries, and extract actionable insights from transactional data.

**🎯 Objectives**

* Analyze a relational database using SQL Server (T-SQL)

* Apply joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions

* Answer business-style analytical questions from sales data

* Write clean, readable, and well-structured SQL queries
