# API Projects

This folder contains completed **API-based data analysis projects** built using Python. Each project focuses on real-world data extraction from APIs, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation.

The projects here are structured as **independent, self-contained case studies**, each maintained in its own folder for clarity and scalability.
